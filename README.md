## Why Use the ChatGPT Code Reviewer Bot?  

### Code Speaks Louder When It's Understood  

In the fast-paced world of coding, explanations often fall by the wayside.  

- A **2020 survey by Stack Overflow** revealed that poor documentation is one of the **top obstacles for developers**, with nearly **60% of professionals citing it as a significant challenge**.  
- Research published by **IEEE Software** highlights that inadequate documentation increases onboarding time and leads to misunderstandings in collaborative environments.  

By integrating this bot into your Discord server, you can ensure clarity and accessibility in coding projects, helping everyone from beginners to experts work more effectively.

### A Home for Coders Everywhere  

Discord has become a vibrant hub for:  
- Collaborative projects.  
- Coding clubs.  
- Game modding communities.  

According to **Discord’s own statistics**, **30% of its active servers are focused on hobbies like programming and modding**.  

These informal teaching and learning spaces are ideal for exploring creative ideas. However, their fast-paced nature often leaves critical code explanations behind. This bot simplifies understanding and participation by:  

- Making code insights easily shareable.  
- Avoiding clutter in discussion channels.  
- Helping newcomers join projects faster.

## Why This Matters  

Every coder has encountered projects where the **"what"** is clear, but the **"why"** remains a mystery.  

- A **GitHub survey** revealed that **documentation gaps are among the most common developer pain points**, even in top-tier open-source projects.  
- In communities such as **game modding** or **peer coding groups**, documentation often takes a backseat to rapid iteration and experimentation.  

The ChatGPT Code Reviewer Bot solves these issues by:  
- Making code more approachable.
